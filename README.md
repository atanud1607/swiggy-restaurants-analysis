Project Title: Swiggy Restaurant Performance Analysis Dashboard

Description:
This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze restaurant performance data from Swiggy. The dashboard provides insights into restaurant ratings, food prices, delivery times, and price range distributions across different cities and areas. The objective is to help in identifying areas for improvement and optimize their restaurant offerings.

Business Questions Addressed:

1. Identifying Cities with Poor Restaurant Ratings:
Objective: Identify cities with a significant number of poorly rated restaurants (ratings below 3).
Approach: Filtered the dataset to isolate restaurants with ratings below 3. Created a bar chart to display the number of poorly rated restaurants by city, highlighting cities with the most significant issues.

2. Average Price of Food per City per Area:
Objective: Determine the average price of food in different cities and areas.
Approach: Used pivot tables to calculate the average price of food for each area within each city. Visualized the data using heatmaps and bar charts to compare prices across different regions.

3. Areas with Highest Number of Top-Rated Restaurants:
Objective: Identify areas with the highest number of top-rated restaurants (ratings above 4.0).
Approach: Filtered the dataset to isolate top-rated restaurants. Created a bar chart to display the number of top-rated restaurants in each area, highlighting areas with the best restaurant ratings.

4. Average Delivery Time by City or Area:
Objective: Calculate the average delivery time for each city and area.
Approach: Used pivot tables to calculate average delivery times. Visualized the results using bar charts and line charts to compare delivery times across different cities and areas.

5. Percentage of Restaurants in Different Price Ranges:
Objective: Determine the percentage of restaurants falling into different price ranges (low: under ₹300, medium: ₹300-₹500, high: above ₹500) in each city.
Approach: Categorized restaurants into the defined price ranges. Created pie charts and stacked bar charts to display the percentage distribution of restaurants within each price range by city.

6. Distribution of Delivery Times Across Rating Categories:
Objective: Analyze how delivery times vary across different restaurant rating categories.
Approach: Segmented the dataset by rating categories (e.g., <3, 3-4, >4). Used box plots and histograms to visualize the distribution of delivery times for each rating category, providing insights into service efficiency relative to restaurant quality.

Tools and Techniques Used:

1. Microsoft Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, calculation of summary statistics, and creation of visualizations.
2. Visualization Tools: Excel charts, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts.
3. Data Analysis: Pivot tables, filtering, and categorization techniques to derive insights from the data.

Key Insights:

1. The dashboard highlights cities with a concentration of poorly rated restaurants, allowing Swiggy to target quality improvement efforts.
2. Comparative analysis of food prices reveals areas with higher or lower average prices, aiding in pricing strategy adjustments.
3. Identification of areas with the highest number of top-rated restaurants showcases regions with exceptional dining options.
4. Average delivery time analysis helps in assessing and improving logistical efficiency.
5. The distribution of restaurants across different price ranges provides a clear picture of the market segmentation in each city.
6. Analysis of delivery times across rating categories offers insights into the correlation between restaurant quality and delivery efficiency.

Conclusion:
The Restaurant Performance Analysis Dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for any food delivery business to evaluate and enhance restaurant performance across various metrics. By leveraging these insights, the business can make informed decisions to improve customer satisfaction, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance delivery efficiency.
